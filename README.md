Minimal-Blog
============

A responsive blog theme for Jekyll. You can see it in use [here](http://nickw.it).

## Features & Preferences

 * Syntax highlighting is *client-side*, using the [jekyll prism plugin](https://github.com/gmurphey/jekyll-prism-plugin). If you want to make sure you have enough languages covered in the stylesheet (`css/prism.custom.css`), make your own at [the Prism site](http://prismjs.com/download.html).
 * Tags listed in the frontmatter of a post are shown on the archive/index page.
 * __Responsive videos__ - Simply follow Bootstrap's [embeds](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/embed/) documentation. The relevant Sass module from Bootstrap is included to enable this.
 * Be sure to check everything in `_config.yml`.
