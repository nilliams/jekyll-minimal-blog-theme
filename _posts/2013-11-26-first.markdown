I'm jumping on the static-site bandwagon, so this site is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [Rackspace Cloud Files](http://rackspace.com).

I had fun making this minimal, responsive Jekyll theme. It's somewhat inspired by the original [minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) theme for Github Pages, but a bit more suitable for blogging. I've made it available on Github [here](https://github.com/nilliams/jekyll-minimal-blog-theme).

### Rackspace

I was going to write a post about the experience of setting the site up on Rackspace, as I did hit a few snags, but then I came across [this excellent post by Philip Thomas](https://www.philipithomas.com/jekyll-on-cloud-files/), which covers everything you need to know.

*The one major caveat revolves around the need to [purge index files from the CDN](https://www.philipithomas.com/jekyll-on-cloud-files/#edge_purge), so look out for that if you decide to go the Rackspace route.*
